# Experiment Lipids

This directory contains data used for an additional experiment for the evaluation of the behaviour of the computed vector space. The goal is to assess the distribution of vectors of incrementally changing lipid structures.

- ```experiment_lipids.csv```: Name and structure definitions of incrementally changing lipids added to the learning model.
- ```experiment_lipid_vectors_100d.csv```: Respective 100-dimensional vectors learned by the model.
- ```experiment_lipid_vectors_tsne_2d.csv```: T-SNE projection of the 100-dimensional vectors to two dimensions.
- ```experiment_lipid_vectors_tsne_3d.csv```: T-SNE projection of the 100-dimensional vectors to three dimensions.
